# Fine-tuning-Foundation-Model-to-Generate-Accurate-Recipe

I extracted samples from an existing dataset available on the Kaggle. The full dataset can be accessed through link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rumitpathare/indian-recipes

By extracting some samples, I was concerned about collecting samples that were relevant to the specific cuisine "Indian Cuisine". Therefore, I got more than 800 samples. Later, I performed a comprehensive data analysis to check for any abnormalities in the data. I removed several features as they were irrelvant. 

I removed duplicate values from the entire dataset. Additionally, I filled null values as they were in less numbers. Moreover, I remove extra spaces from all the fields to make the dataset compiled for the model.
